Points to Consider:
 - The titles most impacted appear to be within Senior Engineering & Senior Staff. 
 - Suprisingly, the mangerial staff appears largely unimpacted, with only 2 retirees predicted. 

The second component of the analysis reflects the employees at Pewlett-Hackard who are eligilbe for the mentorship program who were born in 1965. There are nearly 1,550 employees who are eligible for the mentorship program as exhibited in our analysis.

Points to Consider:
 - This number pales in comparison to the staggering retiree count determined in the intial analysis. 
 - However, it make be worth considering that this value only considers employees born in 1965 and could be expanded upon to increase eligible employees. 

## Summary
As briefly noted in the results section, Pewlett-Hackard can take our analysis to consider long term options. PH can anticipate to need to fill near the ~72,500 roles if no other drastic measures are taken to prepare for this fall out. However, PH has an opportunity to lessen the extent of that hiring need by expanding the membership eligibility criteria to include additional employees born outside of 1965. As exhibited in our analysis, there are approximately 1,550 employees currently eligible given this finite criteria. Further analysis in this PH expansion may yield encouraging results to help fill the massive employee void. An example of this can be seen in the query by expanding the eligibility for the mentorship to include 1965 & 1966, leading to an increase in eligibility to almost 2,000 employees:

Further consideration by PH can yield various results and solutions to their impending retiree challenge.
